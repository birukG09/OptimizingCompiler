# Educational Compiler Test Program
# This program demonstrates the basic features of our minimal language

# Variable declarations with arithmetic expressions
let x = 5 + 3;        # Should evaluate to 8
let y = x * 2;        # Should be 16 (8 * 2)
let z = y - 4;        # Should be 12 (16 - 4)

# Demonstrate constant folding optimization
let a = 10 + 5;       # This will be folded to 15 at compile time
let b = a * 1;        # This will be optimized to just 'a'
let c = b + 0;        # This will be optimized away

# More complex expression
let result = (x + y) * 2 - z;  # Should be (8 + 16) * 2 - 12 = 48 - 12 = 36

# Print statements to show results
print(x);       # Should print 8
print(y);       # Should print 16
print(z);       # Should print 12
print(result);  # Should print 36

# Test unary operators
let negative = -5;
let positive = +10;
print(negative);  # Should print -5
print(positive);  # Should print 10

# Test with parentheses
let complex = (3 + 2) * (4 - 1);  # Should be 5 * 3 = 15
print(complex);   # Should print 15
